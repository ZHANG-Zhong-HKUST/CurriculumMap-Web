No other activity combines mental and physical capacities, science and creativity, individual and group performance, competition and cooperation with such spontaneity, urgency and excitement. Yet sport can be enjoyed as a recreation or as a spectator. Sports are integral and important to our societies, providing jobs, economic growth, health, identity, national pride, entertainment, leisure, inspiration and accomplishment. And, sports are a very good reason to share a drink after playing or watching. Sports reflect our society, how business is organized and how people#s efforts are valued. Sports exhibit advance through merit, but also discrimination, exploitation, gender disparities. They are used to obtain political and economic power. Sports, therefore, are an excellent window into how society works. The course examines the value of sports to society and uses sports to introduce students how the social sciences analyze society, the approaches of the different disciplines and the necessity to take an interdisciplinary approach.", "cre": "3 Credit(s)", "tpre": "", "texc": "", "tcor": "", "pre": {}, "exc": {}, "cor": {}}, "SOSC1510": {"code": "SOSC1510", "name": "Politics Through Film", "des": "This course discusses key concepts in politics using films as course materials.
