The unique painting style of each artist often reflects his/her artistic lineage and knowledge, as well as personal temperament, value and taste. This course gives a brief introduction to the development of Chinese Painting in the past century. While inheriting the traditional model of Chinese Painting, new presentation styles and contents reflecting ordinary lives and society in that period were also explored and created in numerous paintings in response to the dramatic social and political change since the turn of the 20th century. This course focuses on introducing students to the painting styles of a few Chinese painters of the past century, teaching them to appreciate the artists# artistic perceptions and social roles embodied in their works. Through copying and imitating their styles, students will have hands-on practice of the painting principles and skills of Chinese Painting.\u934c\u5d07\u5f53\u6d93\u9366\u5b2c\u8eac\u9423\u95ab\u5fdb\u4eb7\u752f\u5bf0\u6391\u505d\u93b5\u57ae\u54e5\u7e4f\u951b\u5c80\u6699\u7039\u60f0\u682b\u8eac\u9423\u9410\u9e3f\u3003\u95ac\u65bf\u5b29\u6c49\u8e47\u6944\u53ee\u9428\u52eb\u735f\u6d60\u5b36\u7d1d\u7efb\u9423\u6d63\u6ec3\u6427\u9428\u52ef\u2177\u93cd\u714e\u7dda\u5bf0\u9359\u5d86\u69e7\u6d5c\u55d9\u6699\u7039\u5241\u6b91\u752f\u93b5\u5321\u7d1d\u93ac\u0444\u510f\u951b\u5c7d\u6427\u935b\u5ba0\u578f\u701b\u6401\u5a3f\u509a\u5d04\u6d94\u6fc5\u7b18\u7ef1\u93c8\u6d60\u30e4\u7de0\u9428\u52ea\u8151\u9366\u5b2c\u8eac\u9423\u951b\u5c7c\u7af4\u93c2\u5f52\u6f70\u7efb\u517c\u58d9\u6d5c\u55d7\u505d\u7ef2\u8fa9\u8eac\u9423\u701b\u54e5\u7e4f\u9478\u56ea\u3003\u941d\u5267\u6b91\u59af\u2033\u7d21\u951b\u5c7c\u7af4\u93c2\u5f52\u6f70\u9365\u72b3\u5673\u93c5\u5099\u552c\u9428\u52ee\u7569\u95c8\u254b\u7d1d\u95c1\u5b2c\u6ae6\u9351\u9e3f\u016b\u6fb6\u6c2c\u58cd\u93c2\u626e\u6b91\u93b6\u5a09\u66e1\u578f\u9359\u5d86\u69e7\u9423\u6735\u7b05\u59d8\u6220\u6553\u7ec0\u70ac\u6e3b\u9428\u52ef\u5c7e\u6f57\u9286\u509b\u6e70\u747e\u832c\u25bc\u704f\u56e6\u4e92\u6769\u6220\u6ae8\u9a9e\u7fe0\u8151\u9366\u5b2c\u6699\u7039\u5241\u5064\u9352\u56e7\u53c6\u699b\u70c7\u7d1d\u5bee\u66de\u76ab\u701b\u54e5\u6553\u701b\u54e5\u7e4f\u6d93\u5d85\u6093\u7efb\u9423\u68f0\u3126\u7278\u951b\u5c7c\u752b\u6d5c\u55da\u0412\u9423\u9470\u546e\u588d\u94cf\u66df\u6aaa\u6d60\uff47\u6b91\u7ec0\u70ac\u6e3b\u7459\u6395\u58ca\u9286\u509e\u5fdb\u4eb7\u9477\u3126\u61dd\u935a\u5d85\u5241\u6699\u6d63\u6ed0\u7d1d\u7481\u64b3\u54e5\u6553\u942e\u65c2\u7e4f\u6d93\u9366\u5b2c\u8eac\u9423\u6d94\u5b2c\u6699\u941e\u55da\u578f\u93b6\u5a09\u66e0\u74d1\u9417\u5f52\u7cb8\u9286\\"","cre":"1 Credit(s)","tpre":"","texc":"HART 1042","tcor":"","pre":{},"exc":{"AND":["HART1042"]},"cor":{}},"HART1033":{"code":"HART1033","name":"The Art and Making of Dance Video","des":"Dance video is not simply recording a dance performance, but is an intermedia art genre taking the advantage of both video and dance elements to create a dance video artistically.

The purpose of this course is to build a foundation for students from different academic backgrounds who may have little or no knowledge of Chinese culture and history.

However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.","cre":"3 Credit(s)","tpre":"(IEDA 2510 (prior to 2018-19) OR IEDA 2520 OR IEDA 2540 OR ELEC 2600) AND (MATH 2111 OR MATH 2121 OR MATH 2131 OR MATH 2350)","texc":"","tcor":"","pre":{"AND":[{"OR":["IEDA2510","IEDA2520","IEDA2540","ELEC2600"]},{"OR":["MATH2111","MATH2121","MATH2131","MATH2350"]}]},"exc":{},"cor":{}},"IEDA3230":{"code":"IEDA3230","name":"Engineering Economics and Accounting","des":"Application of microeconomics to engineering and managerial decision making.

The lectures will differ from high school organic chemistry class: throughout the course, the students will be encouraged to think about how and why chemical reactions occur, and the focus will be placed on explanation of chemical ideas rather than on the delivery of chemical facts. This set of skills should help them tackle chemistry problems in their school curriculum, public exams as well as prepare them for university-level chemistry courses. In addition, the students enrolling in this course will have a chance to visit the NMR facility of the Chemistry Department.","cre":"1 Credit(s)","tpre":"","texc":"","tcor":"","pre":{},"exc":{},"cor":{}},"SISP1110":{"code":"SISP1110","name":"Fundamentals of Neuroscience","des":"The course is offered under the program of the HKUST Summer Institute for secondary school students by the School of Science.

Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan#s political development.
