# Description

This is a Curriculum map web app for HKUST. It shows all prerequisites and prerequisites of prerequisites of a single course.

A running app can be find at [https://zhang-zhong-hkust.github.io/CurriculumMap-Web/](https://zhang-zhong-hkust.github.io/CurriculumMap-Web/).

The idea was first intruduced in a [COMP2012H group project](https://github.com/zory233/CurriculumMap). Please check their Desktop project, it has more functionality. I appreciate their idea, data collection, suggestion, and other help in this project.

Depending on the availability, I will add corequisite or exclusion relation into the web.


# To run in your own machine:

Clone the whole project

Type: `npm install` or `yarn install`

Then type `npm start` or `yarn start`

This will runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
